# Day 1 - Edu - Fortan90

To compile the program you'll need the `gfortran` compiler

```bash
gfortran d1.f90
```

The compiled program will be an `a.out` file (sorry i didn't take the time to look at the flags of the compiler). Run the program redirecting the standard input:

```bash
./a.out < ../sample.in
```
